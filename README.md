# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative Negotiation

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed to simulate and optimize collaborative negotiation scenarios. The system uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to enable agents to learn complex negotiation strategies through iterative interactions.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### Components

1. **NegotiationEnvironment**
   - Manages simulation state
   - Tracks resources (money, time, expertise)
   - Validates and processes agent actions

2. **NegotiationAgent**
   - Deep Q-Network implementation
   - Learns negotiation strategies
   - Approximates action-value functions

3. **MultiAgentNegotiationTrainer**
   - Coordinates agent training
   - Implements experience replay
   - Manages exploration-exploitation trade-off

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The system evaluates agent performance through:
- Collective Utility
- Individual Resource Allocation
- Negotiation Efficiency
- Adaptation to Complex Scenarios

## 🔬 Experiment Configurations

### Customization Options

- Adjust number of agents
- Modify resource types
- Configure neural network architecture
- Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, epsilon decay)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from multi_agent_negotiation import MultiAgentNegotiationTrainer

# Initialize trainer with default 3 agents
trainer = MultiAgentNegotiationTrainer(num_agents=3)

# Train for 5000 episodes
trainer.train(num_episodes=5000)
```

## 📈 Experimental Results

Preliminary experiments demonstrate:
- Emergent collaborative strategies
